# AeroPull v1.0
AeroPull is a standalone tool for scraping and downloading entire FastDL libraries — no Python instalation is required.
It features a simple dark-themed UI, pause/resume support, retry logic and download stats.

# Features
Full FastDL scraper with recursive directory support

File extension and depth filtering

Real-time stats for progress, speed, ETA, and failures

Pause and resume downloads without losing progress

Automatic retries for failed files (up to 3 times)

Download history logging

A splash screen and sound effects

Quick links to GAQ9.com and my YouTube channel

# Usage
Open AeroPull.exe.

Enter the base FastDL URL.

Set optional file type filters or recursion depth.

Click Start and let it download. (will count how many files there are before downloading)

# Why I Made This
Because I can.
Also, some Alternate Reality Game (ARG) investigations require pulling data from game FastDL directories — this tool makes that easy.

# Notes
AeroPull will create a download history log in the program directory.

Paused downloads can be resumed without starting over.
